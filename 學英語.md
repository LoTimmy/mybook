### blah blah變慣用語

老美常把「`blah, blah, blah`」（讀作「巴拉巴拉巴拉」）掛在嘴邊，表示廢話一大堆、不是三言兩語講得完。
「`blah, blah, blah`」的意思是指「等等等」。
全球語言裡不乏這類指涉廢言一堆、沒有意義的用詞，而且它經常都是三字一組。比如，點點點（yada, yada, yada）、XXX及等等等。

`Hi, there!`（`嘿！`）
這是一種親切口語式的打招呼。適用於陌生人之間，也可用於熟人間；像你站在台上，台下聽眾很多，無法一一招呼，就用`Hi, there!`，親切不拘謹，距離就拉近了。也有`Hello, there.` 的說法，比`Hi, there.` 稍正式，跟熟又不熟的人擦肩而過，就可以用`hello there`。

`There you go.`（`就這樣了。`）
這句話的用途很廣：問了一個問題，對方答對了，就說：`There you go!`。表示，答對了，答得好，是種稱讚。看狀況，有時找東西找半天不著，終於找到，用`there you go`，有點像：「這回可讓我逮住你了」；有時也可表示「瞧，我說對了吧。」

例如一位主管和他下屬之間的對話：
下屬: I can do it. I just need to try harder.
主管: `There you go!`（`這樣想就對了！`）

`There you go`經常發生想結束一段對話時候，像在超市買了東西結帳完成後，店員會說，`There you go.`。就這樣了！意味著你可以走了，該下一位。`There you go.` 是美式說法，英國人愛用`There you are.` 意思一般。

`There you go`這句話加了一個`again`，語氣又大不同，`There you go again.` 意思是，「`看吧，你又來這一套了！`」

`Here you go.`（`幹的好。`）
`Here you go.` 和`There you go.`看起來很像，細分`Here you go.` 指的是一件事情還在進行之中，而 `There you go.` 則是事情已經結束，像點杯咖啡，店員把你咖啡遞給你，他會說，`Here you go.` 而不是`There you go.` `Here you go`在這有一點像中文的「`拿好、拿著`」。東西己經到了你手上，他會說，`There you go.`

BetterTouchTool 2.270 (July, 17, 2017)
This is a small but important bugfix update. There will be a bigger update by the end of the month!
Improved "Show Clipboard/Pasteboard History", the Clipboard Manager should now work much better and with all apps.
I'm currently a bit slow on replying to e-mails and Github issues (Too much work). I still read every issue and email you create, so please continue sending feature requests and bug reports. I'll soon have more time to work on BTT again.

BetterTouchTool 2.266 (July, 4, 2017)
Complete rewrite of the "Show Clipboard/Pasteboard History" predefined action. Should be much more performant and powerful now.
Fixed macOS 10.10 und 10.11 compatibility
Fixed various other bugs & performance issues. Snap areas should be faster to display.
BetterTouchTool 2.260 (June, 26, 2017)
Some improvements and fixes for the new Show Clipboard / Pasteboard History predefined action.
Fixed a bug with the "Restore Saved Mouse Position" action.
BetterTouchTool 2.25 (June, 25, 2017)
Added a great new predefined action: "Show Clipboard/Pasteboard History". Basically it keeps a history of your clipboard and allows you to access it at any time. If you haven't used another clipboard management tool yet I highly recommend to try this, it has really improved my efficiency by a lot. It's probably not as powerful as other specialized clipboard management tools out there, but it has some features I was missing with other tools. 
It's disabled by default, you need to assign the "Show Clipboard / Pasteboard History" action to some trigger (e.g. Gesture or Keyboard Shortcut).
You can edit items (text and images) before pasting
You can paste as file (e.g. in Finder)
You can save clippings as files
You can paste multiple at the same time by selecting them while holding CMD.
Easy keyboard navigation (select clipping with arrow keys, press enter to paste)

Fixed various bugs
Improved Dropbox sync
BetterTouchTool 2.20 (May, 30, 2017)
Hopefully fix various hanging/crashing issues that happened after sleep
Moved Touch Bar Apple Scripts and background Apple Scripts to a separate process, this should also solve various crashing issues.
Added very experimental Dropbox sync to advanced prefs (this is currently limited to 500 users while it is in alpha)
Fixed issue with preset import
Completely threw away the previous thumb recognition algorithm and replaced it with something new. Let's see how this works on different systems.
Added "Start Screen Saver" action
Fixed an issue with corner taps
Prevent Tip Taps from triggering while scrolling
Fixed issue that causes the "Trigger Menubar Menu Item" to trigger a wrong item in some cases
Fixed issue with pinches
Fixed jumping mouse cursor issue
Fixed some trackpad freezes
Various other fixes
BetterTouchTool 2.12 (May, 6, 2017)
This should fix most small bugs that have been reported since the 2.10 release. Thank you for installing all the updates! While there was a long beta phase - the 2.10 release was very big and some edge cases always only appear in real-world testing.
If you encounter any bug, please let me know here: github.com/fifafu/BetterTouchTool.
BetterTouchTool 2.10 (May, 4, 2017)
Data Format Change
This is internally a very big update. It completely changes the BetterTouchTool data model in order to support syncing to multiple machines (e.g. via Dropbox). The sync functionality is not yet enabled in this version, but will be very soon if everything goes well.
This version migrates your previous BetterTouchTool data file to the new format, you shouldn't notice this migration.
In case anything goes wrong during the data migration: don't worry. BTT automatically creates backups. Please contact me in case anything goes wrong (best via Github).
New Preset System
Completely new Preset system. Presets are now exported and imported as JSON (thus they can e.g. be edited in a text editor if necessary).
You can now have multiple presets enabled at the same time, one of them has to be selected as master preset.
Completely changed the "Switch to Preset" predefined action in order to support the new preset system.
New JSON based Copy & Paste
Copy & Paste is now also JSON based.
You can copy single gestures by pressing cmd+c
You can copy all gestures of an app by selecting the app and pressing cmd+c
You can copy a app including all of it's gestures and settings by selecting the app and pressing cmd+shift+c
You can paste between different presets and even to other apps.
New Predefined Actions
Added predefined action "Volume Up (Small Step)" and "Volume Down (Small Step)"
Added predefined action "Toggle Dark Mode"
Added predefined action "Toggle Do Not Disturb On/Off"
Added predefined action "Toggle Night Shift (experimental, requires macOS 10.12.4)"
Added predefined action "Add New Space To Mission Control"
Added predefined action "Run Apple Script in background"
Added Caps Lock predefined action
Added a new mode for pasting/inserting custom text. You can now choose between "pasting" and "typing", depending on the use case one might be faster than the other.
Faster Window Snapping
In general Window Snapping should be much faster, especially on retina screens
Window snapping has now a "High Performance Mode" which can be activated in the advanced preferences. It significantly increases the performance of the window snapping animation, but also significantly increases the memory usage of BTT.
Touch Bar
The Touch Bar brightness slider uses a different API and shouldn't be dimmed back by the system anymore.
The Apple Script widget now allows to run Apple Scripts which only update the widget by pressing it. To achieve this, assign the "Run Apple Script (enter directly as text)" predefined action. (You can leave the script field in the widget settings empty if you don't need timer based updates).
Fixed some small layout problems
Mouse Gestures / Drawings
You can now set a minimum movement that is required before starting to recognize right-click drawings.
Drawing gestures should now only be recognized while being drawn with approximately the rotation they were recorded with (can be changed in the advanced settings).
Fixed various bugs with the drawings feature UI.
Other
Fixed issues with corner-clicks triggering corner taps
Fixed issues with four finger taps
Fixed issues with the custom four finger tap sequences
Signed with a new Apple Developer certificate because my old one has expired recently.
More things are logged for the usage statistics (will be improved further soon)
Fixed issue that caused the BTT window to behave weird with Mission Control
Fixed various bugs

BetterTouchTool 2.04 (February, 9, 2017)
Major performance improvements for users with many gestures/shortcuts/actions configured in BTT
Custom drawing gestures can now be drawn by holding down the right mouse button (or two fingers on a trackpad). This currently only works on Sierra. Note: Straight lines are currently not supported by the algorithm used, currently your drawings need to include at least one curve or corner.
Stability improvements & Bugfixes
Fixed Magic Trackpad Mirroring option
Fixed an issue that caused the Magic Mouse gestures to fail for some users
This will be the last version to support OSX 10.8 and 10.9 (unless some critical bugfixes are necessary). It's time to move on :-)

Support for the new MBP's trackpad.
I'm moving to GitHub for issue/feature/idea/question tracking: github.com/fifafu/BetterTouchTool.
Various fixes and improvements
Maybe you need a little Christmas present for a friend? Buy him a BTT license! 😀🎁
BetterTouchTool 1.93 (October, 23, 2016)

Added key repeat functionality to keyboard shortcuts (click the little gear icon next to the shortcut recorder field). This allows you to repeat an action in a specific interval while the shortcut keys are pressed.
Added new predefined action to toggle hide/show a specific application. The predefined action is called "Show/Hide Specific Application"

Added a few new haptic feedback options that use a better API for generating Force Touch feedback. You can configure the feedback in the Advanced Settings => Trackpad => Force Touchpad. The defaults may change soon.
Improved drag to top Mission Control delay (while maximizing windows, it often happened that Mission Control showed up. It now requires more "force" to bring up Mission Control.). This can be disabled in Adanvced Settings =>Window Snapping => "El capitan: Delay Mission Control on top edge".
