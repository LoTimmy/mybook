### blah blah變慣用語

老美常把「`blah, blah, blah`」（讀作「巴拉巴拉巴拉」）掛在嘴邊，表示廢話一大堆、不是三言兩語講得完。
「`blah, blah, blah`」的意思是指「等等等」。
全球語言裡不乏這類指涉廢言一堆、沒有意義的用詞，而且它經常都是三字一組。比如，點點點（yada, yada, yada）、XXX及等等等。

`Hi, there!`（`嘿！`）
這是一種親切口語式的打招呼。適用於陌生人之間，也可用於熟人間；像你站在台上，台下聽眾很多，無法一一招呼，就用`Hi, there!`，親切不拘謹，距離就拉近了。也有`Hello, there.` 的說法，比`Hi, there.` 稍正式，跟熟又不熟的人擦肩而過，就可以用`hello there`。

`There you go.`（`就這樣了。`）
這句話的用途很廣：問了一個問題，對方答對了，就說：`There you go!`。表示，答對了，答得好，是種稱讚。看狀況，有時找東西找半天不著，終於找到，用`there you go`，有點像：「這回可讓我逮住你了」；有時也可表示「瞧，我說對了吧。」

例如一位主管和他下屬之間的對話：
下屬: I can do it. I just need to try harder.
主管: `There you go!`（`這樣想就對了！`）

`There you go`經常發生想結束一段對話時候，像在超市買了東西結帳完成後，店員會說，`There you go.`。就這樣了！意味著你可以走了，該下一位。`There you go.` 是美式說法，英國人愛用`There you are.` 意思一般。

`There you go`這句話加了一個`again`，語氣又大不同，`There you go again.` 意思是，「`看吧，你又來這一套了！`」

`Here you go.`（`幹的好。`）
`Here you go.` 和`There you go.`看起來很像，細分`Here you go.` 指的是一件事情還在進行之中，而 `There you go.` 則是事情已經結束，像點杯咖啡，店員把你咖啡遞給你，他會說，`Here you go.` 而不是`There you go.` `Here you go`在這有一點像中文的「`拿好、拿著`」。東西己經到了你手上，他會說，`There you go.`

`have been`是完成式的用法，可分成三種不同的句型

1. `have been to` **表示到過什麼地方的經驗，通常和`ever`連用**

例句：
`Have you ever been to` the U.S.A? 
「你曾去過美國嗎?」

2. `have been Ving` 現在完成進行式，**表示某事已進行一陣子了，目前仍為進行中**

例句：
`I have been watching` TV for 3 hours.
「我已看了三個小時的電視了」→ 還在看

3. `have been p.p`

現在完成被動式，表示某事已被處理。

例句:
The boy `has been sent` to the hospital. 
「男孩已經送醫了」→ 男孩不會自己送醫，一定是被送，故用被動

1. 完成式
`How have you been?` 「妳過得好嗎?」
`He has been in` America for 2 years. 「他已經在美國兩年了」→人現在在美國
`He has been to` America. 「他已經去過美國了」→人現在不在美國

2. 完成進行式
`I have been loving` you since I first met you.「從第一次見到你，我就一直愛著你」
`We have been playing` basketball for two hours.「我們已經連續打了兩小時的籃球了」→沒停過

3. 完成被動式
`The work has been finished` for two hours.「這工作已經做好兩個鐘頭了」

`for a few years` `幾年`
`for 2 years` `2年`
`for 3 hours` `3小時`

有些英文句子我們已經講到滾瓜爛熟，別人說了上一句，我們幾乎不經大腦就會脫口回答，例如，老外問`How are you?` 我們就回答`Fine.Thank you. And you？`
又或者老外說`Thank you.`我們就回答`You're welcome.`

回答`Thank you.`其實不一定只用`You're welcome.`，可能的回答很多：

`No problem.`（`沒問題`）
`My pleasure.`（`我的榮幸。`）
`Not at all.`（`一點也不。`）
`It's OK.`（`沒關係。`）

老一輩說`You’re welcome.`，年輕人用`No problem.`

仔細想一想，這兩種回答的差異也不見得是年齡使然，真正要判斷的反而是有時候他說謝謝的時候有多認真。`Thank you`這個詞用得太頻繁了，老外說`thank you`有時候是真的感謝你，有時候純粹是客氣話。 這時用`You’re welcome.`顯得太正式，反倒好像自以為幫了什麼大忙。例如，你讓個路，按個電梯，老外說`Thank you`，這個時候用`You’re welcome.`顯得小題大作，用`No problem`自然得多，我聽到很多多老外甚至回應`Uh-huh`。

總是只會用`You're welcome`來回覆嗎？
這的確是個非常有禮貌，在任何場合都適用的句子，但是其實還是有許多其他用法可以表達的，
很多甚至都比`You're welcome`還簡潔，更可以讓你很快就能掌握並立即運用。

1. `Anytime!`
可以用來回覆當對方向你表達感謝之意時，就跟短語`You're welcome! I'm happy to help you anytime!`一樣，
表示”不用客氣，隨時都很樂意喲！”

A：`Thanks for` checking my essay.
「謝謝你幫忙檢查我的文章。」
B：`Anytime!`
「不客氣，隨時都樂意！」

2. `Sure.` / `Sure thing.`
`Sure`在這邊即代表`of course!`(`當然！`)"的意思，從字面上來說也就跟`certainly`,`naturally` or `absolutely`一樣，
皆表示這一點幫助只是理所當然，再正常不過的事呦~你也可以說`sure thing`，這跟`sure.`是一樣的用法。

A：`Thank you for` helping me to carry this.
「謝謝你幫我提這些東西。」
B：`Sure!`
「`當然的啊！`」

3. `Don’t mention it.`
`Mention`也就是「提到對話或書面上的某些事物」。

在這邊就跟`You're welcome. There is no need to thank me.`一樣，
代表不用客氣，這一點小事沒什啦別再謝我了！

A：`Thanks for` buying me a coffee.
「謝謝你幫我買咖啡。」
B：`Don’t mention it.`
「`不客氣，不用在意。`」

4. `Not at all.`
與`don't worry about it`或`there is no need to thank me`相較之下，

`Not at all.`**有較強烈的意味表示就因為這麼一件小事而感謝似乎有點太多餘囉！**

A：`Thank you for` giving me advice.
「謝謝你的建議。」
B：Oh, `not at all`.
「噢！不客氣。一點也不呦~」

5. `No worries!`
換句話說也就是`I didn't do such a difficult thing, so there is no need to worry!`，
代表自己只是幫忙小事一件並不用太在意，也就是`Don't worry about it.`，別放在心上～

A：`Thanks for` giving me a ride to the airport.
「謝謝你載我一程到機場。」
B：`No worries!`
「`不客氣！`」

6. `No problem.`

你或許也猜到這句應該就是`There is no problem.`，`沒有問題`的意思吧！
在這例子的狀況下，帶有些微句子`It's no big deal`的意味，也就是說對於自己的幫忙，覺得沒什麼大不了的，不需要特別道謝。

A：`Thanks for` making me breakfast.
「謝謝你幫我做早餐。」
B：`No problem.`
「不客氣！」

7．`It was nothing.`

照字面直翻中文就是`這沒什麼。`，也就表示自己的幫忙只是舉手之勞、小事一樁，不用客氣啦！

A：`Thank you for` supporting my presentation today.
「謝謝你協助我今天的報告。」
B：`Oh, it was nothing.`
「噢不客氣，沒什麼。」

8．`You bet!`
這句是`it's fine, don't worry about it.`的口語化用法。

A：`Thanks for` fixing my computer.
「謝謝你幫我修理電腦。」
B：`You bet!`
「`不客氣！`」

9．`My pleasure.` / `It’s my pleasure.`

`Pleasure`也就是喜悅、享受和歡喜的意思，
但在這邊的`It's my pleasure`是表示很榮幸可以有機會給予幫助並得到對方的感謝之意。

A：`Thanks for your help.`
「謝謝你的幫忙。」
B：`It’s my pleasure!`
「`我的榮幸！`」

10．`I’m happy to help.` / `I’m glad to help.`

這裡也是用在回覆別人的答謝時的好用句子，意思就跟我們中文裡常說的「`很開心可以幫到你`」


A：`Thanks for` correcting my writing.”
「謝謝你幫我修正文章。」
B：`I’m glad to help.`
「不客氣，我很樂意能夠幫助到你。」

`for the time being`
目前；暫時
 
【說明】
`being` 僅在本片語才作形容詞用，意思是「`現在的`」。`for the time being` 常用來暗示「`目前`」的情況只是暫時的，不會持續很久。

【相似句】
`for now`、`for the moment`、`for the present`「目前」

---

`I don't give a shit.` 是什麼意思呢？

意思和`I don't care.`差不多，只是較為粗俗。

其實就是「`我一點也不在意`」、「`我完全才不在乎`」的意思。乍看之下，`I don't give a shit.`好像跟這個意思連不上關係，
但只要想像一下下面這個情境對白，應該馬上就會覺得很好記了。
『嗚嗚.. 我為你付出這麼多，你卻連個屎也不給我！』
（連個屎也不給，所以想必一定是不在乎到了無以復加的地步了…）
不過由於`shit`這個字本身實在太過粗俗，
所以有些人會改用`I don't give a damn.`，意思大致上是一樣的，
相對的，如果口味想再重一點，也可以改成`I don't give a fuck.`。

來造個句好了：
I have two exams tomorrow, but `I don't give a shit`.
我明天有兩個考試，但我完全不看在眼裡

I gave her heart earrings as a gift, but `she didn't give a shit`.
我送她心型的耳環當禮物，人家卻完全把我當空氣
最後，如果大家有注意到的話，其實`魔力紅`的歌「`Moves Like Jagger`」就有用到這個句子
You say I’m a kid,（你說我像個小孩子）
My ego is bare,（我的自我完全不加遮掩）
`I don’t give a shit!`（而我一點也不在意）

若要指明不想理會些甚麼
可於`shit`後加上前置詞 (`preposition`) `about`
再寫上名詞或名詞詞組。

A：Where did Tom go? 
阿 Tom 到哪裡去了?
B：`I don't give a shit.` 我才不理會。

A：I think you've gone too far. 
我覺得你這次做得有點過份。

B：`I don't give a shit what you think.` 
我才不理你怎樣想。

BetterTouchTool 2.270 (July, 17, 2017)
This is a small but important bugfix update. There will be a bigger update by the end of the month!
Improved "Show Clipboard/Pasteboard History", the Clipboard Manager should now work much better and with all apps.
I'm currently a bit slow on replying to e-mails and Github issues (Too much work). I still read every issue and email you create, so please continue sending feature requests and bug reports. I'll soon have more time to work on BTT again.

BetterTouchTool 2.266 (July, 4, 2017)
Complete rewrite of the "Show Clipboard/Pasteboard History" predefined action. Should be much more performant and powerful now.
Fixed macOS 10.10 und 10.11 compatibility
Fixed various other bugs & performance issues. Snap areas should be faster to display.
BetterTouchTool 2.260 (June, 26, 2017)
Some improvements and fixes for the new Show Clipboard / Pasteboard History predefined action.
Fixed a bug with the "Restore Saved Mouse Position" action.
BetterTouchTool 2.25 (June, 25, 2017)
Added a great new predefined action: "Show Clipboard/Pasteboard History". Basically it keeps a history of your clipboard and allows you to access it at any time. If you haven't used another clipboard management tool yet I highly recommend to try this, it has really improved my efficiency by a lot. It's probably not as powerful as other specialized clipboard management tools out there, but it has some features I was missing with other tools. 
It's disabled by default, you need to assign the "Show Clipboard / Pasteboard History" action to some trigger (e.g. Gesture or Keyboard Shortcut).
You can edit items (text and images) before pasting
You can paste as file (e.g. in Finder)
You can save clippings as files
You can paste multiple at the same time by selecting them while holding CMD.
Easy keyboard navigation (select clipping with arrow keys, press enter to paste)

Fixed various bugs
Improved Dropbox sync
BetterTouchTool 2.20 (May, 30, 2017)
Hopefully fix various hanging/crashing issues that happened after sleep
Moved Touch Bar Apple Scripts and background Apple Scripts to a separate process, this should also solve various crashing issues.
Added very experimental Dropbox sync to advanced prefs (this is currently limited to 500 users while it is in alpha)
Fixed issue with preset import
Completely threw away the previous thumb recognition algorithm and replaced it with something new. Let's see how this works on different systems.
Added "Start Screen Saver" action
Fixed an issue with corner taps
Prevent Tip Taps from triggering while scrolling
Fixed issue that causes the "Trigger Menubar Menu Item" to trigger a wrong item in some cases
Fixed issue with pinches
Fixed jumping mouse cursor issue
Fixed some trackpad freezes
Various other fixes
BetterTouchTool 2.12 (May, 6, 2017)
This should fix most small bugs that have been reported since the 2.10 release. Thank you for installing all the updates! While there was a long beta phase - the 2.10 release was very big and some edge cases always only appear in real-world testing.
If you encounter any bug, please let me know here: github.com/fifafu/BetterTouchTool.
BetterTouchTool 2.10 (May, 4, 2017)
Data Format Change
This is internally a very big update. It completely changes the BetterTouchTool data model in order to support syncing to multiple machines (e.g. via Dropbox). The sync functionality is not yet enabled in this version, but will be very soon if everything goes well.
This version migrates your previous BetterTouchTool data file to the new format, you shouldn't notice this migration.
In case anything goes wrong during the data migration: don't worry. BTT automatically creates backups. Please contact me in case anything goes wrong (best via Github).
New Preset System
Completely new Preset system. Presets are now exported and imported as JSON (thus they can e.g. be edited in a text editor if necessary).
You can now have multiple presets enabled at the same time, one of them has to be selected as master preset.
Completely changed the "Switch to Preset" predefined action in order to support the new preset system.
New JSON based Copy & Paste
Copy & Paste is now also JSON based.
You can copy single gestures by pressing cmd+c
You can copy all gestures of an app by selecting the app and pressing cmd+c
You can copy a app including all of it's gestures and settings by selecting the app and pressing cmd+shift+c
You can paste between different presets and even to other apps.
New Predefined Actions
Added predefined action "Volume Up (Small Step)" and "Volume Down (Small Step)"
Added predefined action "Toggle Dark Mode"
Added predefined action "Toggle Do Not Disturb On/Off"
Added predefined action "Toggle Night Shift (experimental, requires macOS 10.12.4)"
Added predefined action "Add New Space To Mission Control"
Added predefined action "Run Apple Script in background"
Added Caps Lock predefined action
Added a new mode for pasting/inserting custom text. You can now choose between "pasting" and "typing", depending on the use case one might be faster than the other.
Faster Window Snapping
In general Window Snapping should be much faster, especially on retina screens
Window snapping has now a "High Performance Mode" which can be activated in the advanced preferences. It significantly increases the performance of the window snapping animation, but also significantly increases the memory usage of BTT.
Touch Bar
The Touch Bar brightness slider uses a different API and shouldn't be dimmed back by the system anymore.
The Apple Script widget now allows to run Apple Scripts which only update the widget by pressing it. To achieve this, assign the "Run Apple Script (enter directly as text)" predefined action. (You can leave the script field in the widget settings empty if you don't need timer based updates).
Fixed some small layout problems
Mouse Gestures / Drawings
You can now set a minimum movement that is required before starting to recognize right-click drawings.
Drawing gestures should now only be recognized while being drawn with approximately the rotation they were recorded with (can be changed in the advanced settings).
Fixed various bugs with the drawings feature UI.
Other
Fixed issues with corner-clicks triggering corner taps
Fixed issues with four finger taps
Fixed issues with the custom four finger tap sequences
Signed with a new Apple Developer certificate because my old one has expired recently.
More things are logged for the usage statistics (will be improved further soon)
Fixed issue that caused the BTT window to behave weird with Mission Control
Fixed various bugs
Please report any issue you encounter via Github: http://github.com/fifafu/BetterTouchTool.

BetterTouchTool 2.04 (February, 9, 2017)
Major performance improvements for users with many gestures/shortcuts/actions configured in BTT
Custom drawing gestures can now be drawn by holding down the right mouse button (or two fingers on a trackpad). This currently only works on Sierra. Note: Straight lines are currently not supported by the algorithm used, currently your drawings need to include at least one curve or corner.
Stability improvements & Bugfixes
Fixed Magic Trackpad Mirroring option
Fixed an issue that caused the Magic Mouse gestures to fail for some users
This will be the last version to support OSX 10.8 and 10.9 (unless some critical bugfixes are necessary). It's time to move on :-)

Maybe you need a little Christmas present for a friend? Buy him a BTT license! 😀🎁
BetterTouchTool 1.93 (October, 23, 2016)

BetterTouchTool 1.91(2) (October, 6, 2016)
Fixed some of the reported Sierra issues regarding keyboard shortcuts
Added key repeat functionality to keyboard shortcuts (click the little gear icon next to the shortcut recorder field). This allows you to repeat an action in a specific interval while the shortcut keys are pressed.
Added new predefined action to toggle hide/show a specific application. The predefined action is called "Show/Hide Specific Application"
You can now specifiy that a shortcut should already trigger on "key-down" (default is on "key-up"). This can also be done by pressing the little gear icon next to the shortcut recorder field.
Added a few new haptic feedback options that use a better API for generating Force Touch feedback. You can configure the feedback in the Advanced Settings => Trackpad => Force Touchpad. The defaults may change soon.
Improved drag to top Mission Control delay (while maximizing windows, it often happened that Mission Control showed up. It now requires more "force" to bring up Mission Control.). This can be disabled in Adanvced Settings =>Window Snapping => "El capitan: Delay Mission Control on top edge".
